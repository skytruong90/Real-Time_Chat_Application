# Projct Name: Real-Time Chat Application

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a simple yet effective real-time chat application. It aims to demonstrate skills in Java, understanding of networking concepts, and the ability to implement real-time communication.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Simple login and registration system.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages instantly.
- **Multiple Chat Rooms**: Ability for users to join different chat rooms or create new ones.
- **Basic UI**: A simple but intuitive user interface.
- **Database Integration**: For storing user credentials and chat history (optional).

## Technologies
- **Java**: Core language for building the application.
- **JavaFX**: For the user interface.
- **Sockets**: For real-time communication between clients and server.
- **MySQL/SQLite**: For the database (optional).

## Steps to Develop
1. **Setup Java Environment**: Ensure Java and an IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) are ready.
2. **Design the Application**: Plan the basic architecture - client-server model, UI layout, etc.
3. **Implement Server**: Create a server to handle multiple client connections using sockets.
4. **Build Client Application**: Develop the client-side application that connects to the server.
5. **UI Development**: Use JavaFX to design the user interface.
6. **Database Integration**: Implement a database for user data and chat history (if time allows).
7. **Testing**: Test the application for bugs and user experience improvements.
